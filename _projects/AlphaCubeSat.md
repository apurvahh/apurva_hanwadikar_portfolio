Alpha CubeSat is a 3U student-designed CubeSat developed at Cornell University and selected by NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI). The mission focuses on demonstrating compact, low-mass deployable systems for future small satellite applications. The project includes a light sail experiment, flexible antenna deployment, and a custom mechanical release system, all validated through rigorous testing campaigns aligned with launch and flight qualification standards.

Project Objectives

- Demonstrate a spring-loaded light sail deployment mechanism for future passive propulsion
- Design and test a flexible, nitinol-actuated antenna system capable of surviving stowage and deployment in orbit.
- Launch a solar powered CubeSat from the International Space Station 

My Role – Integration and Testing Lead

As Integration & Testing Lead, I was responsible for managing the physical and functional integration of Alpha CubeSat’s subsystems. My contributions included:

Mechanical Design & Prototyping
- Designed and iterated the light sail deployment mechanism using spring-loaded arms, incorporating constraints for stowage volume, dynamic stability, and deployment sequencing.
- Developed a novel antenna deployment concept using nitinol wire actuation and flexible materials to reduce packing volume and complexity.

Thermal and Environmental Testing
- Designed and executed thermal vacuum (TVAC) and thermal cycle tests simulating orbital temperature and pressure conditions.
- Conducted high-altitude balloon tests to validate mechanical deployment in near-space environments.
Oversaw vibration testing and system-level checks in compliance with NASA GEVS launch qualification standards.

Systems Integration
- Developed a subsystem integration plan and tracked mechanical-electrical interface dependencies.
- Worked with avionics and software teams to verify that mechanical constraints aligned with harness routing, antenna RF path placement, and mission power budgets.
- Managed mechanical fit checks, stowage validation, and post-test inspections to ensure system readiness.

Validation and Documentation
- Created CAD models and built mechanical systems to test out fit and installation. Wrote semesterly reports and presented my research at a poster session. 


Mission Impact
- Alpha CubeSat contributes to the future of low-mass, high-functionality satellite systems by validating deployable subsystems that could be used for propulsion, communications, or attitude control in next-generation spacecraft. The project builds capacity for deep integration of mechanical systems into the constrained CubeSat form factor, and paves the way for sustainable and low-cost access to space science.
