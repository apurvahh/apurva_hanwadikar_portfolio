As part of a class, I conducted a hands-on experimental physics project to study chaos in a Chua circuit, focusing on the relationship between resistance and chaos, as quantified by Lyapunov exponents.
Key Contributions:
Circuit Setup and Data Collection: Built an RLC circuit with a potentiometer to vary resistance and used oscilloscopes to capture voltage time series data for chaotic and non-chaotic regimes.
Quantifying Chaos: Calculated Lyapunov exponents by analyzing the divergence of nearby trajectories in voltage time series, using MATLAB and Python to process data and create visualizations.
Visualization: Reconstructed strange attractors from oscilloscope data to confirm chaotic behavior in the circuit, identifying single-scroll attractors for specific resistance values.
Error Analysis: Identified sources of uncertainty in resistance measurements and time-series data, including multimeter limitations and data coarseness, and proposed improvements for future experiments.
Theoretical Connections: Explored differential equations describing the Chua circuit and their parallels with established chaotic systems like the Lorenz map.
This project sharpened my skills in experimental design, programming, and analyzing nonlinear systems, while deepening my understanding of chaos theory and its practical applications.
