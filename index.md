## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
I'm a Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell University, pursuing minors in Aerospace Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Physics. My passion lies in space systems engineering and advancing human spaceflight. Through my role as Integration and Testing Lead for Cornell’s Alpha CubeSat — a student-built satellite selected by NASA’s CubeSat Launch Initiative — I’ve gained hands-on experience in spacecraft integration, environmental testing, and the challenges of designing deployable systems for space. I also contribute to the Cornell Mars Rover team as a member of the Drives Subteam, where I’ve worked on full-system mechanical design. These experiences have shaped my interest in multidisciplinary space hardware development and deepened my commitment to innovation in aerospace. Beyond technical work, I actively support efforts to build a more inclusive aerospace community as the Mentorship Coordinator for Cornell’s Women in Aerospace and Aeronautics.
